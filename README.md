Random experiments with Assembly Script

After a day or so of playing with ASSemblyScript (july 2020) it really seems like it's not ready for doing much more than toy codes and edge case offloading.

If you don't hate Rust syntax it's probably your only reasonable choice to target wasm at this point.
